            <p>I have been on acne medication since I was 15 but after I started using this, I haven't had a single breakout. I have combination skin and I get really dry during the winter, but this doesn't dry me out. I also tend to get tiny whiteheads around the area where I wear my glasses, but this soap removes it so effectively!</p>

            <p><img src="review-pictures/abercrombie and fitch jeans.PNG" alt="Abercrombie and Fitch Jeans" width="345" height="345">
            <p>This year, I decided I'm gonna wear jeans that are comfortable. I don't want to be jumping up and down my room trying to get into skinny jeans. I am prioritizing my comfort over fashion. However, every single time I wear these, I get a compliment on them. And every single time, people cannot believe that they're from Abercrombie and Fitch! They fit so nicely, they are so flattering and comfortable, and they're long enough that even though I'm 5'9" I didn't have to get the Tall kind.</p>

            <h2><a href = "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0836L49CT">Plush Slipper</a></h2>

            <p><img src="review-pictures/amazon slippers.jpg" alt="Fuzzy Slippers" width="345" height="345">
            <p>These look really nice and I've gotten compliments on them whenver people see me wearing them. However, the sole of the shoe pills really bad. Even after washing, it didn't ever get back it's fuzzy, soft texture on the sole. The top still looks fuzzy but the sole could be improved.</p>

            <h2><a href = "https://www.amazon.com/AmLactin-Smoothing-Alpha-Hydroxy-Exfoliates-Non-greasy/dp/B07CD5P419">AmLactin Ultra Smoothing Intensely Hydrating Cream</a></h2>

            <p>I get really bad ezcema during the winter months. I usually have to buy prescription medication creams to help with my ezcema. However, this AmLactin cream has changed the game! It got rid of all my dry, rough, cracking spots overnight. It works so well! I usually put on a layer and then wear cotton gloves over it. </p>

            <h2><a href = "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QHW9Q2X">Cable Holder</a></h2>

            <p><img src="review-pictures/cable organizers.jpg" alt="desktop cable organizers" width="345" height="345">
            <p>I get really annoyed when my charging cable falls off the nightstand. These little cable holders work great! I usually yank my phone in the morning when the alarm goes off, but my cable holder does not budge. It's been really helpful.</p>

            <h2><a href = "https://www.sephora.com/product/nomade-eau-de-parfum-P428451">Chlo√© Nomade Eau de Parfum</a></h2>

            <p><img src="review-pictures/chloe nomade perfume.jfif" alt="Chloe Nomade Perfume" width="345" height="345">
            <p>This is the most pleasant perfume ever. It's a floral scent but it's not the headache-y, overwhelmingly floral type scent. It's really well made and it lasts a while after the first spray. If you need to give someone a perfume as a gift and you want a crowd pleaser, look no further. </p>

            <h2><a href = "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-guest-list-lucy-foley/1132922952">The Guest List: A Novel by Lucy Foley</a></h2>

            <p><img src="review-pictures/guest list.jpg" alt="A book, guest list by lucy foley" width="345" height="460">
            <p>I love the mystery/thriller genre and this really hit the spot. It's so gripping and well-written. No wonder it won the Good Reads' readers' choice awards last year! Let me know if you read this and we can discuss how crazy it gets at the end!!</p>

            <h2><a href = "https://www.jomalone.com/product/25946/71841/colognes/gardenia-oud-absolu">Jo Malone London Gardenia & Oud Absolu Perfume</a></h2>
            <p>     </p>
            <p><img src="review-pictures/Jo Malone Gardenia and Oud.jpg" alt="Jo Malone Gardenia and Oud Perfume" width="345" height="345">
            <p>This costs $300. It's the most expensive perfume I have ever bought. I loved the way it smelled when I first tried out. I could really smell it on myself and I loved it. But after I bought the bottle and spray it on myself, I could barely smell it on myself. My friends told me that they could smell it on me but I couldn't. Whenever I did it smell it on me, it smelled a lot like paper. Like literal paper from a brand new notebook. I'm not sure that this was worth the money. If you do buy any Jo Malone perfumes, buy it from a person in one of their store locations! They give you lots of free gifts with your purchase, which is nice.</p>

            <p><img src="review-pictures/medium board game.jfif" alt="A board game in a box, called Medium" width="345" height="345">
            <p>This is a really fun and unique board game! I loved playing it with my friends. It helped us all bond and get to know each other. I love how unique the idea is!</p>

            <h2><a href = "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HCZYLVL">Small Dry Erase White Board</a></h2>

            <p><img src="review-pictures/Whiteboard.jpg" alt="A gold framed whiteboard" width="345" height="460">
            <p>This is a super cute whiteboard! It's hanging in my room and I can quickly write down ideas that I have and stuff that comes to my mind. The gold frame makes it look really nice and fancy. </p>
